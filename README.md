## FEATURES

 - Auto updates once a user defined percentage has been watched
 - Should detect split anime (Example: Ascendance of a Bookworm has 1 Season on [CR]((https://www.crunchyroll.com/ascendance-of-a-bookworm)) but 2 Seasons on [Anilist](https://anilist.co/anime/113693/Honzuki-no-Gekokujou-Shisho-ni-Naru-Tame-ni-wa-Shudan-wo-Erandeiraremasen-2/)
 - User configurable when to update (Based on percentage watched)
 - Should auto update Repeated Status... CURRENTLY NOT WORKING! (I think...)

## TODO

 - Add new websites
